This README file came with PE. I just updated a few things.

![BetadciuEngineLogo](docs/img/BETADCIUEngineLogo.png)

Engine originally used on [Blantados](https://www.youtube.com/@Blantados21) BETADCIU's and Covers, intended to be a easy and versatile engine for cover makers.

## Installation:

Refer to [the Build Instructions](/docs/building.md)

## Customization:

If you wish to disable things like *Lua Scripts* or *Video Cutscenes*, you can refer to the `Project.xml` file.

Inside `Project.xml`, you will find several variables to customize Psych Engine to your liking.

To start you off, disabling *Video Cutscenes* should be simple, simply delete the line `"VIDEOS_ALLOWED"` or comment it out by wrapping the line in XML-like comments, like this: `<!-- YOUR_LINE_HERE -->`

Same goes for *Lua Scripts*, comment out or delete the line with `LUA_ALLOWED`, this and other customization options are all available within the `Project.xml` file.

## Softcoding (.lua/.hx)
For this you can head over to [the Psych's Lua wiki](https://shadowmario.github.io/psychengine.lua)

There you can learn how to use the 212 PlayState funcions of the original Psych Engine in your mod!

# Features

## Proper Stage Switching:
* A dedicated Event/Function to make Stage Changes, making Stage transitions easier to do.
![Stage Switching](docs/img/StageSwitch.gif)

## Character Flipping and Offsets:
* So you don't have to make "character-player.json" ;)
![Player Offsets](docs/img/PlayerOffsets.png)

## New Main Menu
* A brand new menu that makes your experience even better!
![Main Menu](docs/img/MainMenu.png)

## Attractive animated dialogue boxes:

## Mod Support
* Probably one of the main points of this engine, you can code in .lua files outside of the source code, making your own weeks without even messing with the source!
* Comes with a Mod Organizing/Disabling Menu.
![Mod Support](docs/img/ModsMenu.png)

## Cool new Chart Editor changes and countless bug fixes
![Chart Editor](docs/img/chart.png)
* You can now chart "Event" notes, which are bookmarks that trigger specific actions that usually were hardcoded on the vanilla version of the game.
* Your song's BPM can now have decimal values
* You can manually adjust a Note's strum time if you're really going for milisecond precision
* You can change a note's type on the Editor, it comes with five example types:
  * Alt Animation: Forces an alt animation to play, useful for songs like Ugh/Stress
  * Hey: Forces a "Hey" animation instead of the base Sing animation, if Boyfriend hits this note, Girlfriend will do a "Hey!" too.
  * Hurt Notes: If Boyfriend hits this note, he plays a miss animation and loses some health.
  * GF Sing: Rather than the character hitting the note and singing, Girlfriend sings instead.
  * No Animation: Character just hits the note, no animation plays.

## Multiple editors to assist you in making your own Mod
![Master Editor Menu](docs/img/editors.png)
* Working both for Source code modding and Downloaded builds!

## Story mode menu rework:
![Story Mode Menu](docs/img/storymode.png)
* Added a different BG to every song (less Tutorial)
* All menu characters are now in individual spritesheets, makes modding it easier.

## Credits menu
![Credits Menu](docs/img/credits.png)
* You can add a head icon, name, description and a Redirect link for when the player presses Enter while the item is currently selected.

## Awards/Achievements
* The engine comes with 16 example achievements that you can mess with and learn how it works (Check Achievements.hx and search for "checkForAchievement" on PlayState.hx)
![Achievements](docs/img/Achievements.png)

## Options menu:
* You can change Note colors, Delay and Combo Offset, Controls and Preferences there.
 * On Preferences you can toggle Downscroll, Middlescroll, Anti-Aliasing, Framerate, Low Quality, Note Splashes, Flashing Lights, etc.
![Options](docs/img/Options.png)

## Other gameplay features:
* When the enemy hits a note, their strum note also glows.
* Lag doesn't impact the camera movement and player icon scaling anymore.
* Some stuff based on Week 7's changes has been put in (Background colors on Freeplay, Note splashes)
* You can reset your Score on Freeplay/Story Mode by pressing Reset button.
* You can listen to a song or adjust Scroll Speed/Damage taken/etc. on Freeplay by pressing Space.
* You can enable "Combo Stacking" in Gameplay Options. This causes the combo sprites to just be one sprite with an animation rather than sprites spawning each note hit.
